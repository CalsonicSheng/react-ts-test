/*

- in client side, its all about react each page is built and rendered based on corresponding page-level functional component at client side with matching route

- there are also other re-useable or children components that can be used in the page-level functional components

- the navigation in these framework is client-side default, the previous page-level functional component will be unmounted and the new page-level functional component will be mounted.

- "onMount" is also a "re-rendering" process

  - when onMount, the corresponding FE functional component will run all its js codes FIRST TIME on the client-side (just like re-rendering), without requiring a full-page reload (very important)

    - this is because all the process is handled entirely by FE js code that updates DOM element accordingly for new page component and data fetching is also handled by FE js code 
    through AJAX (very important)
    
    - in previously traditional nav, browser will make a request to server to fetch the whole new html file, and then replace the whole page in the browser, results in a full page 
    reload (very important)

    - browser is not involved in this nav process for fetching, and no html file replacement is conducted, so no full page reload is required (very important)
  
  - If new data is needed from page component onMount, that data is retrieved through ajax, not a whole new HTML page. Once the data is fetched, it's managed and tracked by the component's state 
  ensures that only the necessary parts of the DOM are updated in response to state changes (no full page reload is required).

    - ajax typically used to fetch data in the form of JSON, XML, or other text-based format that can be processed by JS code and affect DOM. This is because the primary purpose of AJAX is 
    to update PARTS of a web page without requiring a full page reload (this is why it is not used for fetch whole new html file).

    - comparing to traditional fetching which involve the browser making a request through browser search bar (GET request), HTML forms (GET or POST) or links (<a> tags)) to fetch the entire 
    page (html file) from the server. This will later replace the entire page in the browser, results in a full page reload (very important)

    - ajax is also conducted asynchrously, this means rest of the js code will not be blocked by the ajax request, and will continue to run while waiting for the ajax response (very important)

- re-rendering overall:

  - full re-rendering process involve following 4 steps when a state update function/navigation/switching is conducted:

    1. recall/re-execute target componment function body: React will call the component function again with the updated state and props to get the latest processed JSX code.

    2. Create a New Virtual DOM Tree: React will create a new virtual DOM tree (based on latest comopnent jsx with updates state) from the returned JSX.

    3. Diffing/reconciliation: React will compare this new virtual DOM tree with the previous one to find the differences (or "diffs").

    4. Update the Real DOM: React will update the real DOM to match the new virtual DOM, but only the parts that have changed. (efficient than updating the entire DOM).

  - if states remains the same after update, if you use the useState hook and set the state to the same value it already has, React will bail out of the re-render process early and wonâ€™t 
  re-call/execute the component function and all rest of the process.

    - the re-rendering process is still triggered (very important), but the steps are mostly skipped, and the component function is not re-called/execute again 

  - re-rendering can be triggered by:

    - component switching

    - component navigation

    - state update function call (major)

  - re-rendering types:

    - onMounting: When a component is FIRST created and added to the DOM

    - Re-rendering: When a component is updated with new state data

    - Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM
    
    react lifecycle hooks will recognize and differentiate these types
